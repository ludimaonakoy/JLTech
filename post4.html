                    <h3>Learn Python Programming In The Easiest Way</h3>
                    <p>If you're interested in the ins and outs of web development,
                         I’m excited to share with you the basics of web development and 
                         the exhilarating process of creating a website from scratch.
                         Understanding this difference has been crucial in my career, 
                         allowing me to appreciate the depth and breadth of skills 
                         required in the world of web creation. It's a reminder of
                          the diverse talents and expertise that come together
                          to make the digital world what it is today.
                         <br><br>Web development refers to the overall process of
                          creating websites or web applications, including the project’s 
                          design, layout, coding, content creation, and functionality.
                           It involves using a combination of programming languages, tools,
                            and frameworks to bring a website or web application to life. 
                            It may also encompass project management activities, such as fielding 
                         development requests from stakeholders or freelance clients. 
                         Web programming, on the other hand, specifically refers to the 
                         coding and scripting of a website, whether the front-end or back-end. 
                         It primarily involves writing code to handle data, process user inputs, and generate dynamic content. A web programmer will rarely, if ever, handle a web development project from end to end. They may build
                          a certain section of a site or troubleshoot bugs.
                          HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is what connects our
                           website request to the remote server that houses all website data. 
                           It’s a set of rules (a protocol) that defines how messages should be sent over the Internet. 
                          It allows us to jump between site pages and websites

                          If I type a website into my web browser or search for something 
                          through a search engine, HTTP provides a framework so that the 
                          client (computer) and server can speak the same language when 
                          they make requests and responses to each other over the Internet. It’s essentially the translator between you and the Internet — it reads our website request, reads the code sent back from the server, 
                          and translates it for us in the form of a website.
